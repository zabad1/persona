		<!-- Persona-->
		<h4>As person that is very fond of cinema. I enjoy going on to IMDB to look up films and resumes. Things that I enjoy that I look up is qoutes, triva, filming locations, and soundtracks. For any person that is slightly interested in a certain show, movie, or person. IMDB is a great site to find that infromation. </h4>
		<!-- Case-->
		<h4>All though I love reading about triva and other things on IMDB. I need to put a stop to the useless triva information that other users put on the site. I must hack IMDB and become the main host so that no one can put useless information on it.</h4>
		<!--Examples of bad triva-->
		<h4>Here is two examples of different movies, one being a highly popular movie that has a lot of triva and the second example having very little triva added to it.</h4>
		<!-- Links to movie triva-->
