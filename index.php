		<h3>As person that is very fond of cinema. I enjoy going on to IMDB to look up films and resumes. Things that I enjoy that I look up is qoutes, triva, filming locations, and soundtracks. For any person that is slightly interested in a certain show, movie, or person. IMDB is a great site to find that infromation. </h3>
		<!-- Paragraph 2-->
		<h3>A thing you can do on IMDB is add to the content of the film. So you as a user can add to the triva. If you find imformation or spot something in a movie that isn't on the site, you can add to it. But you must have a IMDB account to do so. But there can be problems with the input information. Highly popluar movies can have a lot information and lesser known movies will have very little info to their contents. </h3>
		<!-- Paragraph 3-->
		<h3>Here is two examples of different movies, one being a highly popular movie that has a lot of triva and the second example having very little triva added to it.</h3>
